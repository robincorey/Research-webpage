		<div id="Sec-mediated transport">
			<p> The bulk of protein secretion is conducted by the ubiquitous Sec translocon, which also acts as the principle route for the insertion of membrane proteins. In bacteria, the translocon comprises SecY, SecE and usually SecG, with the protein-conducting pore through the centre of SecY. This complex can associate with either the ribosome for co-translational protein translocation – the main pathway for nascent membrane protein insertion – or with the motor protein SecA for post-translational secretion. In the latter case the fully synthesised protein is maintained in an unfolded conformation by chaperones, such as SecB, and SecA itself. The protein must then fold during or after the translocation processs </p> <br>
