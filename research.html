			<h3 id="sec"> Mechanism of Sec-mediated translocation </h3>
			<p> In every cell, the Sec translocon acts as the primary route for proteins to either cross or insert into the plasma membrane. In bacteria, the translocon comprises SecY, SecE and usually SecG, with the protein-conducting pore through the centre of SecY. This complex can associate with either the ribosome for co-translational protein translocation - the main pathway for nascent integral membrane proteins to enter the membrane - or with the motor protein SecA for post-translational secretion.  </p>

			<p> I'm interested in the mechanism of how Sec drives protein transport, specifically how the freen energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis and the proton-motive-force act to generate directional motion of the pre-protein.
			<h3 id="lipid"> Protein-lipid interactions </h3>
			<p> I'm very interested in how lipid modulate membrane protein structure and function. Some of the specific systems I'm interested in ae described in more detail below. </p>
			<h4> CFTR-cholesterol </h4>
			<p> Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a complexly-regulated epithelial Cl- channel and a unique member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein family. <br /><br />CFTR comprises a cytoplasmic ATPase domain, formed from two Walker A and B containing nucleotide binding domains, and a transmembrane region formed from two transmembrane domains. Between TMD1 and 2 is a channel through which Cl- ions are conducted across the membrane. In addition to these domains is the regulatory R domain (Fig. 1; blue), which needs to be phosphorylated before the channel can open </p>

			<h4> Cardiolipin-Sec </h4>
			<p>CL is an anionic phospholipid, found on a variety of energy-producing membranes including the mitochondrial inner membrane and the plasma membrane of many different bacteria and archaea. CL has an unusual structure, comprising two PG molecules joined by a glycerol head group. This provides each CL molecules with two phosphate head groups and four acyl chains. <br /><br />
			CL likely has an important role in bioenergetics processes, as evidenced by its presence on energy transducing membranes and co-isolation with a considerable number of bioenergetics protein complexes â€“ including the mitochondrial ATP synthase at a tri-methylated lysine residue,  as well as with SecY. CL binding sites are typified by the presence of one or more basic residues that form pockets of positive charge on the surface of the protein as shown strutrally.<br /><br /></p>

			<p>
			We are interested in application of the MARTINI force field towards identification of CL binding sites in SecYEG.We aim to verify the data using experimental techniques previously applied to the same system, as well as using native mass spectroscopy
